Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia project helping to create
world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.
It is supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of freely

of November 2020. It currently has more than 56 million articles in more than

contributors in the past month.
